/* Variables
*
* 0. Just like in math, variables can be whatever we want them to be in our code. 
* They are the container that hold our data. Variables allow us to store a value 
* like name, number,  or other data types that we we can use anytime later 
* in the code.
*/

// 1. Declaration and assignment //

// To use a variable first you have to define it. //

    //Example of Declaration a variable//
    
        var eddy;
        
        var ed;
        
        var edd;
        
// Assignment is giving the variable a value and you do that when you give it an a assignment operator follow by the value//

     var eddy = "money hungry";
     
     var edd = "to smart for these two"
    
     var ed = "carefree don't care about nothing" 

// 2. Var, If, and Const // 

/* In the first couple of example I use the keyword called Var. Var is not the only
* keyword. There are two other called If, and Const. Each are use at different point in the code.
* It depend on the scope they are in. To learn about scope, go to my function section.
*/

// 3. Hoisting //

// Hoisting is pretty much assigning a variable before it declare. //

// Example of hoisting

     x = 9;
     
     var x;
